								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>In a world with tens of billions of internet connected devices, avoiding
										technology in daily life is impossible. While life is easier and more 
										convenient than ever due to technology, this has resulted in the 
										excessive use of screens in daily life and the neglect of physical health. 
										While technology has also been linked with many adverse psychological effects
										like anxiety and depression, this site will focus on the physical impacts,
										which often go unrecognized, despite being wide-ranging and ubiquitous.
										</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>
										For instance, over 500 million people globally suffer from low back pain,
										60% of Americans are affected by digital eye strain, and 1.1 billion young people 
										worldwide are at risk of hearing loss from unsafe listening habits. Furthermore,
										research has shown technology to cause an array of other problems, including musculoskeletal issues, disrupted sleep,
										delayed digestion, stress, obesity, neurological impairments, developmental defects 
										in children, cardiovascular disorders including cancer and heart disease, and more.

							<h2>The problem is growing</h2>
							<p>Technology will only become more and more engrained in our lives</p>
						</header>
						<p>The global average screentime is 6 hours 58 minutes per day, an increase of
							50 minutes per day since 2013. Extrapolated across all global 
							internet users, that's over 180 million additional days. This is even worse
							among younger people, who average 9 hours of screentime per day.
							With this, the negative impacts of technology will be exacerbated.
							For instance, while 500 million people suffer from low back pain currently,
							 the number of cases will increase to 850 million by 2050, with a similar
							trend for other risks.
